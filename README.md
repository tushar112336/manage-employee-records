This C++ program is designed to manage employee records. It allows users to add, modify, delete, and display employee data.

Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

1. Add Data: The addData() function adds new employee records to a file named "EMPLOYEE.txt". Users can add multiple records at once.

2. Modify Data: The modifyData() function modifies existing employee records. Users can update the name, age, and ID of an employee.

3. Delete Data: The deleteData() function deletes existing employee records based on the employee ID.

4. Display Data: The displayData() function displays all existing employee records.

5. Menu-Driven Interface: The program uses a menu-driven interface to allow users to choose which operation to perform. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.

The program uses file handling to store and retrieve employee data, and it uses a switch statement to execute the corresponding function based on the user's input.
